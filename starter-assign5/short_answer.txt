WARMUP:
Q1. _id maintains the same value, _x increments by 3, and _y increments by 4 after every iteration.

Q2.  After a few iterations, the values of the member variables remain stagnant.

Q3. The stuck ball is now located on the upper left hand corner and it moves normally.

Q4. The program crashed when I tried accessing an index outside the allocated array bounds.

When I tried to delete the same memory twice, it appears to working correctly.

Accessing memory after it has been deleted caused my program to crash.


String Instrument

Q5: When the string is first created, the waveform array is set to all 0s. When it is first plucked,
the first half of the array is set to +0.05, and the second half of the array is set to -0.05.

Q6: The new waveform array would look like: 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0, 0, -0.05, -0.05, -0.05.

Q7: Changing the buffer values from +0.05 and -0.05 to +0.25 and -0.25 would increase the frequency, or pitch
of the sound. You would hear a higher pitch.
